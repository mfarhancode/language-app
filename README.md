This is an ongoing project where I am building a web-based language learning app with the help of ChatGPT. While learning the Indonesian language, I got the idea to create an app that could support vocabulary and sentence practice in an interactive way. Since it involves advanced topics like Flask and other areas I have not fully learned yet, I relied on ChatGPT to guide me through the development process.

The app uses local JSON files to manage words and progress, and includes features such as learning new words, practicing known words, saving difficult words or sentences for focused practice, and tracking progress. The focus is on keeping the app self-contained without external databases, so all data remains local.

Although the project is not complete yet, it already demonstrates problem-solving in structuring data, creating practice flows (like auto-saving known words and sentence practice), and handling user interaction with a clean and minimal design.
